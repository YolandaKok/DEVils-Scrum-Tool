Use Json Web Token (JWT) for this feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Also, partition users into anonymous and authenticated and give them the right permissions to modify or access data.                                                                                                                 |

The user interface should be tested early in the design process to avoid common mistakes.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 8  | Usability                   | Consistency and System Standards                      | The user interface must be consistent.  1. The layout should be the same across the application.  2. The navigation bar must be in the same place. 3. Use the same wording and visualization for the same functions.                                                                                                                                   |

(e.g. A task from the todo list on the sprint page.) 2. The primary action should be emphasized. (e.g. Submit button in a form) 3. When he/she completes a form.

| 10 | Usability                   | Minimalistic Design                                   | The user interface should follow minimalistic design: 1. The interface should be easy to get used to. 2. Lots of text should be avoided.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11 | Maintainability             | Modularity                                            | The code should be build in modules, so that independent parts accomplish independent tasks. This could be accomplished through the use of functions, interfaces and classes.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12 | Maintainability             | Design Patterns                                       | Use of design patterns to solve common code modelling problems. (e.g. MVC pattern on back end and front end.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 13 | Maintainability             | High Cohesion - Low Coupling                          | - High cohesion means that we should bind the related code together as close as possible. - The low coupling means that we should organize our code through interfaces and make our classes be as independent as possible.                                                                                                                             |
| 14 | Maintainability             | Layered Application Design                            | Application would consist of different layers like Presentation Layer, Bussiness Layer and Data Layer (3-Tier).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 15 | Scalability                 | Compress Files                                        | Minimize the number of static assets, such as images, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), required by the application. Use always minified (.min.js) files for javascript files.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16 | Scalability                 | AJAX Calls                                            | Use AJAX-based asynchronous models for server invocations for partial page refresh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 17 | Mobility                    | Operational System in different Devices and Platforms | The system should be operational in a wide range of devices and platforms, such as different screen sizes (Responsive) and web browsers.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 18 | Extensibility               | Follow RESTful Architecture                           | Make a RESTful API which could be used in a future extension of our platform to a mobile application (Android, ios) without many changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 19 | Extensibility               | Documentation (UML diagrams, navigation flow)         | Present a general approach of the structure of the web application using UML diagrams. A new team member will possibly be informed of the current project state.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 20 | Deployment                  | Deploy on a remote server                             | The application will be independent of the development environment. It will be instantly deployed in any remote server that runs tomcat.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
